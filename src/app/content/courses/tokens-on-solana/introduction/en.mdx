# One Program, Every Token

Creating a token on Ethereum costs $50 in gas fees. On Solana: $0.02. Transferring that token? Ethereum: $15. Solana: $0.00025.

The cost difference isn't just about cheaper transactions—it's an architectural choice. Ethereum requires deploying a complete smart contract for each token. Solana uses a single program—SPL Token—that handles all tokens on the network.

Every token on Solana works the same way, which creates composability. Wallets, DEXs, and dApps integrate once and support all tokens without custom code per token, compatibility issues, or security variations between implementations.

Solana doesn't track transactions—it tracks account states. Your SOL balance lives in your wallet account. Your USDC balance lives in a separate token account owned by you but managed by SPL Token program. If you're not familiar with [Solana's account model](/en/courses/understanding-solana/solana-architecture), it's essential foundation for understanding tokens.

**Three account types create the token system:**

**Mint Account** - The token's birth certificate:
- Total supply (how many tokens exist)
- Decimals (6 decimals = 1 token = 1,000,000 base units)
- Mint authority (who can create more tokens)
- Freeze authority (who can freeze token accounts)

One mint account per token type: USDC has one mint, BONK has one mint, your project token has one mint.

**Token Account** - Holds balances for one owner:
- Which mint (USDC, BONK, etc.)
- Owner (your wallet address)
- Amount (current balance)
- Delegate (optional: who can spend on your behalf)

Each person needs a token account for each token they hold. Hold 5 different tokens? You have 5 token accounts, each owned by your wallet.

**Associated Token Account (ATA)** - The default token account:
- Deterministically derived from owner + mint
- Everyone knows your USDC ATA address without asking
- One per person per token type

ATAs are normal token accounts at predictable addresses. Instead of creating random addresses and telling everyone "here's my USDC account," your USDC ATA lives at an address anyone can calculate from your wallet address + USDC mint address.

SPL Token is a program deployed once that manages all tokens on Solana. It's not a template—it's the actual running program at address `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`.

When you create a token, you don't deploy code. You create a mint account owned by SPL Token program. When you transfer tokens, you call SPL Token program with your token accounts. The program validates and executes.

Every token follows identical rules—USDC transfers work exactly like your project token transfers with the same validation logic, security guarantees, and interface.

Wallets integrate once. Supporting "all SPL tokens" means supporting one program's instruction format. No per-token integration. No compatibility testing across hundreds of implementations.

DeFi protocols compose reliably. Jupiter aggregator swaps any SPL token pair because they all behave identically. Lending protocols accept any SPL token as collateral. No special cases.

Security audits apply universally. SPL Token has been audited extensively. Those audits protect every token using it. One well-tested program protects trillions in value.

<ArticleSection name="Compared to Ethereum" id="compared-ethereum" level="h2" />

Ethereum's ERC-20 is a standard, not a program. Deploying an ERC-20 token means deploying a smart contract that implements the standard's interface: `transfer()`, `approve()`, `balanceOf()`, etc.

**Every token is custom code:**

Token A implements transfer logic. Token B implements the same logic differently. Both claim "ERC-20 compliant" but might have bugs, gas optimizations, or security issues unique to their implementation.

Wallets must trust that each token correctly implements the standard. No guarantees. Some tokens add transfer fees. Some have pausing mechanisms. Some have rebasing supply. All call themselves "ERC-20."

DeFi integration requires caution. DEXs and lending protocols must handle weird token behaviors: transfer fees break calculations, rebasing breaks accounting, pausing breaks withdrawals. Every token is a potential edge case.

**Solana's advantage:**

One implementation tested extensively. No per-token code review needed. No "this token implements transfer differently" issues. SPL Token program defines behavior. All tokens inherit that behavior.

<ArticleSection name="Cost and Speed at Scale" id="cost-speed" level="h2" />

**Token creation:**
- Ethereum: Deploy ERC-20 contract = $50-200 depending on gas prices
- Solana: Create mint account = $0.02 (0.00144 SOL rent deposit)

**Token transfers:**
- Ethereum: $5-50 depending on network congestion
- Solana: $0.00025 (5,000 lamports)

**Minting 1 million tokens:**
- Ethereum: One mint transaction, variable gas cost
- Solana: Multiple transactions needed due to compute limits, but total cost under $10

**Creating token accounts for 10,000 users:**
- Ethereum: Users each pay gas to deploy their position tracking
- Solana: Create 10,000 ATA accounts = $200 total (0.00144 SOL × 10,000)

The cost structure enables different applications. Airdropping tokens to thousands of users becomes economically viable. Gaming items as tokens makes sense when minting costs $0.00025 instead of $15. Loyalty programs can issue tokens for small actions.

Ethereum's 12-second block time means waiting minutes for transfer confirmation. Solana's 400ms slot time means sub-second finality. Real-time applications become practical.

<ArticleSection name="Token Extensions and Evolution" id="token-extensions" level="h2" />

SPL Token launched in 2020. By 2024, developers wanted new features: metadata in mint accounts, transfer hooks, permanent delegates, interest-bearing tokens, confidential transfers.

Ethereum solution: Deploy new ERC standards (ERC-777, ERC-1155, ERC-4626). Each requires custom smart contract implementation. No backward compatibility. Ecosystem fragments.

Solana solution: Token Extensions program (Token-2022). It extends SPL Token with 16 new optional extensions while maintaining backward compatibility. Old programs work with new tokens. New features activate only when explicitly enabled.

This architecture allows evolution without fragmentation. The token ecosystem upgrades together rather than splintering into incompatible standards.

<ArticleSection name="What This Course Covers" id="what-this-course-covers" level="h2" />

Solana tokens work through an account model: mint accounts define tokens, token accounts hold balances, SPL Token program enforces rules.

**You'll learn:**

How mint accounts control supply and permissions. What mint authority and freeze authority mean. Why some tokens can create infinite supply while others have fixed caps.

How token accounts work and why each token needs a separate account. What Associated Token Accounts solve and how programs find them deterministically. When you need multiple token accounts for the same token.

What token extensions add beyond basic SPL Token. How Token-2022 enables metadata, transfer hooks, and other advanced features. When to use extensions and what trade-offs they introduce.

How this all connects to building: creating tokens, minting supply, transferring between accounts, managing authorities. The practical operations every token application performs.

After this course, you'll understand why every Solana token works the same way—and why that uniformity is Solana's advantage.

Next: understanding mint accounts and how they control token supply.
