# Key Takeaways

[The double-spending problem](/courses/blockchain-fundamentals/digital-trust-problem) seemed mathematically impossible to solve without central authority. [Cryptographic primitives](/courses/blockchain-fundamentals/how-blockchains-work)—hash functions, digital signatures, and Merkle trees—make fraud detectable. [Consensus mechanisms](/courses/blockchain-fundamentals/achieving-consensus)—Proof of Work and Proof of Stake—make fraud economically irrational. [Bitcoin](/courses/blockchain-fundamentals/bitcoin-first-blockchain) combined these innovations into the first working blockchain.

Blockchains replace trusted intermediaries with verifiable computation. Instead of asking "who do we trust?", blockchains ask "what behavior do incentives encourage?" When attack costs exceed attack gains, rational participants choose honesty. Mathematics detects fraud. Economics prevents it.

Bitcoin proved the concept works. The UTXO model tracks individual coins like physical cash. Proof of Work makes rewriting history prohibitively expensive. Conservative parameters prioritize security and decentralization over throughput. Bitcoin processes 7 transactions per second. Visa processes 65,000. This tradeoff is intentional—Bitcoin optimizes for censorship resistance and security rather than speed.

The blockchain trilemma explains why "just make it faster" fails. Blockchains can optimize for at most two of three properties: security, scalability, and decentralization. Bitcoin chose security and decentralization. Ethereum made similar choices. Breaking the trilemma requires architectural innovation, not parameter tuning.

These fundamentals apply to every blockchain. [Programmable blockchains](/courses/evolution-programmable-blockchains/ethereum-programmable-money) build on this foundation to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications.

**What is the double-spending problem and how does blockchain solve it?**

Digital files copy infinitely, so without a central authority, nothing prevents sending the same coin to multiple people. Blockchain solves this through distributed consensus—every transaction is broadcast to thousands of nodes that independently validate it and add it to a shared ledger. Once recorded in a block, the transaction becomes part of an immutable chain. Spending the same coin twice would require rewriting blockchain history while the network continues adding blocks, which becomes economically impossible as computational costs exceed any potential gain.

**How do blockchains work without a central authority?**

Blockchains combine three cryptographic tools: hash functions create tamper-evident records, digital signatures prove ownership, and Merkle trees allow efficient verification. These tools make fraud mathematically detectable. Distributed ledgers ensure thousands of nodes keep identical copies, making tampering obvious. Consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) make lying economically irrational—attacking costs more than honest participation. Mathematics makes fraud detectable and economics makes fraud unprofitable. No trusted authority is needed when the system aligns incentives correctly.

**What is Proof of Work and why does Bitcoin use it?**

Proof of Work requires miners to solve computationally expensive puzzles to propose blocks. Finding a valid Bitcoin block requires approximately 2^77 hash calculations—that is 151 million trillion trillion attempts. This makes attacking the network prohibitively expensive: an attacker would need to outpace all honest miners' combined computational power continuously. However, verifying a solution takes milliseconds, keeping participation cheap. Difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to maintain 10-minute block times regardless of mining power. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work because it provides the strongest security guarantees and has the longest proven track record, prioritizing security over energy efficiency.

**What is the UTXO model?**

Bitcoin's UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model works like physical cash. Instead of tracking account balances, Bitcoin tracks individual "coins." When you receive bitcoin in three separate transactions, you have three UTXOs—like having three physical bills in your wallet. To spend 1.0 BTC when you have UTXOs of 0.5 BTC and 0.8 BTC, you must consume both (totaling 1.3 BTC), send 1.0 BTC to the recipient, and receive 0.3 BTC back as change. This creates two new UTXOs while destroying the inputs. Each UTXO can only be spent once, which allows parallel transaction processing without conflicts.

**Why is Bitcoin limited to 7 transactions per second?**

Bitcoin's 7 TPS limit comes from deliberate design choices prioritizing security and decentralization. Blocks are produced every 10 minutes and limited to approximately 1 megabyte. Faster blocks would cause network splits where miners work on competing chains. Larger blocks would require more bandwidth and storage, preventing individuals from running full nodes and centralizing validation. Bitcoin sacrifices throughput to ensure anyone with consumer hardware can independently verify the entire blockchain. This tradeoff keeps Bitcoin decentralized but makes it impractical for high-volume payments. Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network address this by processing payments off-chain.

**Can Bitcoin run smart contracts?**

Bitcoin has limited smart contract capability through its scripting language, which supports basic conditions like multi-signature wallets (requiring signatures from M of N keys) and time locks (releasing funds after a specific time). The language deliberately lacks loops and complex operations to minimize attack surface and prevent bugs. Bitcoin cannot run complex applications like lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, or autonomous organizations. The limitation is intentional—Bitcoin optimizes for being secure money, not a general-purpose computer. Ethereum was created specifically to add programmability that Bitcoin's design excludes.
